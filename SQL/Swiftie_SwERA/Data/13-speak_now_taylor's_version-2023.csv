Speak Now Taylor's Version,Mine,1,"You were in college, working part-time, waiting tables",1
Speak Now Taylor's Version,Mine,1,Left a small town and never looked back,2
Speak Now Taylor's Version,Mine,1,"I was a flight risk, with a fear of falling",3
Speak Now Taylor's Version,Mine,1,"Wondering why we bother with love, if it never lasts",4
Speak Now Taylor's Version,Mine,1,"I say, ""Can you believe it?""",5
Speak Now Taylor's Version,Mine,1,As we're lying on the couch,6

Speak Now Taylor's Version,Mine,1,"Yes, yes, I can see it now",8
Speak Now Taylor's Version,Mine,1,"Do you remember, we were sitting there, by the water?",9
Speak Now Taylor's Version,Mine,1,You put your arm around me for the first time,10
Speak Now Taylor's Version,Mine,1,You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter,11
Speak Now Taylor's Version,Mine,1,You are the best thing that's ever been mine,12
Speak Now Taylor's Version,Mine,1,"Flash forward, and we're taking on the world together",13
Speak Now Taylor's Version,Mine,1,And there's a drawer of my things at your place,14
Speak Now Taylor's Version,Mine,1,You learn my secrets and you figure out why I'm guarded,15
Speak Now Taylor's Version,Mine,1,You say we'll never make my parents' mistakes,16
Speak Now Taylor's Version,Mine,1,But we got bills to pay,17
Speak Now Taylor's Version,Mine,1,We got nothing figured out,18
Speak Now Taylor's Version,Mine,1,When it was hard to take,19
Speak Now Taylor's Version,Mine,1,"Yes, yes",20

Speak Now Taylor's Version,Mine,1,You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter,24
Speak Now Taylor's Version,Mine,1,You are the best thing that's ever been mine,25
Speak Now Taylor's Version,Mine,1,Do you remember all the city lights on the water?,26
Speak Now Taylor's Version,Mine,1,You saw me start to believe for the first time,27
Speak Now Taylor's Version,Mine,1,You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter,28
Speak Now Taylor's Version,Mine,1,You are the best thing that's ever been mine,29
Speak Now Taylor's Version,Mine,1,"And I remember that fight, 2:30 AM",30
Speak Now Taylor's Version,Mine,1,As everything was slipping right out of our hands,31
Speak Now Taylor's Version,Mine,1,"I ran out, crying, and you followed me out into the street",32
Speak Now Taylor's Version,Mine,1,Braced myself for the goodbye,33
Speak Now Taylor's Version,Mine,1,Cause that's all I've ever known,34
Speak Now Taylor's Version,Mine,1,"Then, you took me by surprise",35
Speak Now Taylor's Version,Mine,1,"You said, ""I'll never leave you alone.""",36

Speak Now Taylor's Version,Sparks Fly,2,And I'm a house of cards,2
Speak Now Taylor's Version,Sparks Fly,2,You're the kind of reckless,3
Speak Now Taylor's Version,Sparks Fly,2,That should send me running,4
Speak Now Taylor's Version,Sparks Fly,2,But I kinda know that I won't get far,5
Speak Now Taylor's Version,Sparks Fly,2,And you stood there in front of me,6
Speak Now Taylor's Version,Sparks Fly,2,Just close enough to touch,7
Speak Now Taylor's Version,Sparks Fly,2,Close enough to hope you couldn't see,8
Speak Now Taylor's Version,Sparks Fly,2,What I was thinking of,9
Speak Now Taylor's Version,Sparks Fly,2,Drop everything now,10
Speak Now Taylor's Version,Sparks Fly,2,Meet me in the pouring rain,11

Speak Now Taylor's Version,Sparks Fly,2,Give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around,16
Speak Now Taylor's Version,Sparks Fly,2,Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile,17
Speak Now Taylor's Version,Sparks Fly,2,My mind forgets to remind me,18
Speak Now Taylor's Version,Sparks Fly,2,You're a bad idea,19
Speak Now Taylor's Version,Sparks Fly,2,You touch me once and it's really something,20
Speak Now Taylor's Version,Sparks Fly,2,You find I'm even better than you imagined I would be,21
Speak Now Taylor's Version,Sparks Fly,2,I'm on my guard for the rest of the world,22

Speak Now Taylor's Version,Back to December,3,Your guard is up and I know why,6
Speak Now Taylor's Version,Back to December,3,Because the last time you saw me,7
Speak Now Taylor's Version,Back to December,3,Is still burned in the back of your mind,8
Speak Now Taylor's Version,Back to December,3,"You gave me roses, and I left them there to die",9
Speak Now Taylor's Version,Back to December,3,So this is me swallowing my pride,10
Speak Now Taylor's Version,Back to December,3,"Standing in front of you, saying I'm sorry for that night",11
Speak Now Taylor's Version,Back to December,3,And I go back to December all the time,12
Speak Now Taylor's Version,Back to December,3,It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you,13
Speak Now Taylor's Version,Back to December,3,Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine,14
Speak Now Taylor's Version,Back to December,3,"I'd go back to December, turn around and make it alright",15

Speak Now Taylor's Version,Back to December,3,"These days, I haven't been sleeping",17
Speak Now Taylor's Version,Back to December,3,"Staying up, playing back myself leaving",18
Speak Now Taylor's Version,Back to December,3,When your birthday passed and I didn't call,19
Speak Now Taylor's Version,Back to December,3,"And I think about summer, all the beautiful times",20
Speak Now Taylor's Version,Back to December,3,I watched you laughing from the passenger side and,21
Speak Now Taylor's Version,Back to December,3,Realized I loved you in the fall,22
Speak Now Taylor's Version,Back to December,3,And then the cold came,23
Speak Now Taylor's Version,Back to December,3,The dark days when fear crept into my mind,24
Speak Now Taylor's Version,Back to December,3,"You gave me all your love, and all I gave you was goodbye",25
Speak Now Taylor's Version,Back to December,3,So this is me swallowing my pride,26

Speak Now Taylor's Version,Back to December,3,"So good to me, so right",34
Speak Now Taylor's Version,Back to December,3,And how you held me in your arms that September night,35
Speak Now Taylor's Version,Back to December,3,The first time you ever saw me cry,36
Speak Now Taylor's Version,Back to December,3,Maybe this is wishful thinking,37
Speak Now Taylor's Version,Back to December,3,Probably mindless dreaming,38
Speak Now Taylor's Version,Back to December,3,"But if we loved again, I swear I'd love you right",39
Speak Now Taylor's Version,Back to December,3,"I'd go back in time and change it, but I can't",40
Speak Now Taylor's Version,Back to December,3,"So if the chain is on your door, I understand",41
Speak Now Taylor's Version,Back to December,3,But this is me swallowing my pride,42
Speak Now Taylor's Version,Back to December,3,"Standing in front of you, saying I'm sorry for that night",43

Speak Now Taylor's Version,Speak Now,4,I sneak in and see your friends,6
Speak Now Taylor's Version,Speak Now,4,And her snotty little family,7
Speak Now Taylor's Version,Speak Now,4,All dressed in pastel,8
Speak Now Taylor's Version,Speak Now,4,And she is yelling at a bridesmaid,9
Speak Now Taylor's Version,Speak Now,4,Somewhere back inside a room,10
Speak Now Taylor's Version,Speak Now,4,Wearing a gown shaped like a pastry,11
Speak Now Taylor's Version,Speak Now,4,This is surely not,12
Speak Now Taylor's Version,Speak Now,4,What you thought it would be,13
Speak Now Taylor's Version,Speak Now,4,I lose myself in a daydream,14

Speak Now Taylor's Version,Speak Now,4,"And they said, ""speak now""",21
Speak Now Taylor's Version,Speak Now,4,Fond gestures are exchanged,22
Speak Now Taylor's Version,Speak Now,4,And the organ starts to play,23
Speak Now Taylor's Version,Speak Now,4,A song that sounds like a death march,24
Speak Now Taylor's Version,Speak Now,4,And I am hiding in the curtains,25
Speak Now Taylor's Version,Speak Now,4,It seems that I was uninvited,26
Speak Now Taylor's Version,Speak Now,4,By your lovely bride-to-be,27
Speak Now Taylor's Version,Speak Now,4,She floats down the aisle,28
Speak Now Taylor's Version,Speak Now,4,Like a pageant queen,29

Speak Now Taylor's Version,Dear John,5,"Well, maybe it's me",17
Speak Now Taylor's Version,Dear John,5,And my blind optimism to blame,18

Speak Now Taylor's Version,Dear John,5,To give love and take it away,20
Speak Now Taylor's Version,Dear John,5,And you'll add my name to your long list of traitors,21
