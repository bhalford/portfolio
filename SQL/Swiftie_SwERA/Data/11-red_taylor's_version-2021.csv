Red Taylor's Version,State of Grace,1,I'm walking fast through the traffic lights,1
Red Taylor's Version,State of Grace,1,Busy streets and busy lives,2
Red Taylor's Version,State of Grace,1,And all we know is touch and go,3
Red Taylor's Version,State of Grace,1,We are alone with our changing minds,4
Red Taylor's Version,State of Grace,1,We fall in love 'til it hurts or bleeds,5
Red Taylor's Version,State of Grace,1,Or fades in time,6
Red Taylor's Version,State of Grace,1,And I never (Never),7
Red Taylor's Version,State of Grace,1,Saw you coming,8
Red Taylor's Version,State of Grace,1,And I’ll never (Never),9
Red Taylor's Version,State of Grace,1,Be the same,10
Red Taylor's Version,State of Grace,1,You come around and the armor falls,11
Red Taylor's Version,State of Grace,1,Pierce the room like a cannonball,12
Red Taylor's Version,State of Grace,1,Now all we know is don’t let go,13
Red Taylor's Version,State of Grace,1,"We are alone, just you and me",14
Red Taylor's Version,State of Grace,1,Up in your room and our slates are clean,15
Red Taylor's Version,State of Grace,1,"Just twin fire signs, four blue eyes",16
Red Taylor's Version,State of Grace,1,So you were never a saint,17
Red Taylor's Version,State of Grace,1,And I've loved in shades of wrong,18
Red Taylor's Version,State of Grace,1,We learn to live with the pain,19
Red Taylor's Version,State of Grace,1,Mosaic broken hearts,20
Red Taylor's Version,State of Grace,1,But this love is brave and wild,21
Red Taylor's Version,State of Grace,1,And I never (Never),22
Red Taylor's Version,State of Grace,1,Saw you coming,23
Red Taylor's Version,State of Grace,1,And I’ll never (Never),24
Red Taylor's Version,State of Grace,1,Be the same,25
Red Taylor's Version,State of Grace,1,This is a state of grace,26
Red Taylor's Version,State of Grace,1,This is the worthwhile fight,27
Red Taylor's Version,State of Grace,1,Love is a ruthless game,28
Red Taylor's Version,State of Grace,1,Unless you play it good and right,29
Red Taylor's Version,State of Grace,1,These are the hands of fate,30
Red Taylor's Version,State of Grace,1,You’re my Achilles heel,31
Red Taylor's Version,State of Grace,1,This is the golden age,32
Red Taylor's Version,State of Grace,1,Of something good and right and real,33
Red Taylor's Version,State of Grace,1,And I never (Never),34
Red Taylor's Version,State of Grace,1,Saw you coming,35
Red Taylor's Version,State of Grace,1,And I’ll never,36
Red Taylor's Version,State of Grace,1,Be the same,37

Red Taylor's Version,Treacherous,3,And I'd be smart to walk away,7
Red Taylor's Version,Treacherous,3,But you're quicksand,8

Red Taylor's Version,All Too Well,5,"And you've still got it in your drawer, even now",4
Red Taylor's Version,All Too Well,5,"Oh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze",5

Red Taylor's Version,All Too Well,5,And I know it's long gone and,9
Red Taylor's Version,All Too Well,5,That magic's not here no more,10
Red Taylor's Version,All Too Well,5,"And I might be okay, but I'm not fine at all",11
Red Taylor's Version,All Too Well,5,"Oh, oh, oh",12
Red Taylor's Version,All Too Well,5,Cause there we are again on that little town street,13
Red Taylor's Version,All Too Well,5,You almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at me,14
Red Taylor's Version,All Too Well,5,"Wind in my hair, I was there",15
Red Taylor's Version,All Too Well,5,I remember it all too well,16
Red Taylor's Version,All Too Well,5,"Photo album on the counter, your cheeks were turning red",17
Red Taylor's Version,All Too Well,5,You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed,18
Red Taylor's Version,All Too Well,5,And your mother's telling stories 'bout you on the tee-ball team,19
Red Taylor's Version,All Too Well,5,"You tell me 'bout your past, thinking your future was me",20
Red Taylor's Version,All Too Well,5,And I know it's long gone and,21
Red Taylor's Version,All Too Well,5,There was nothing else I could do,22
Red Taylor's Version,All Too Well,5,And I forget about you long enough,23
Red Taylor's Version,All Too Well,5,To forget why I needed to,24
Red Taylor's Version,All Too Well,5,Cause there we are again in the middle of the night,25
Red Taylor's Version,All Too Well,5,We're dancing ‘round the kitchen in the refrigerator light,26
Red Taylor's Version,All Too Well,5,"Down the stairs, I was there",27
Red Taylor's Version,All Too Well,5,"I remember it all too well, yeah",28
Red Taylor's Version,All Too Well,5,Maybe we got lost in translation,29
Red Taylor's Version,All Too Well,5,Maybe I asked for too much,30
Red Taylor's Version,All Too Well,5,But maybe this thing was a masterpiece,31
Red Taylor's Version,All Too Well,5,Til you tore it all up,32
Red Taylor's Version,All Too Well,5,"Running scared, I was there",33
Red Taylor's Version,All Too Well,5,I remember it all too well,34
Red Taylor's Version,All Too Well,5,And you call me up again,35
Red Taylor's Version,All Too Well,5,Just to break me like a promise,36
Red Taylor's Version,All Too Well,5,So casually cruel in the name of being honest,37
Red Taylor's Version,All Too Well,5,I'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here,38
Red Taylor's Version,All Too Well,5,"Cause I remember it all, all, all",39
Red Taylor's Version,All Too Well,5,Too well,40
Red Taylor's Version,All Too Well,5,"Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it",41
Red Taylor's Version,All Too Well,5,"I'd like to be my old self again, but I'm still trying to find it",42
Red Taylor's Version,All Too Well,5,After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own,43
Red Taylor's Version,All Too Well,5,Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone,44
Red Taylor's Version,All Too Well,5,But you keep my old scarf from that very first week,45
Red Taylor's Version,All Too Well,5,Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me,46
Red Taylor's Version,All Too Well,5,You can't get rid of it,47
Red Taylor's Version,All Too Well,5,"Cause you remember it all too well, yeah",48
Red Taylor's Version,All Too Well,5,Cause there we are again when I loved you so,49
Red Taylor's Version,All Too Well,5,Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known,50
Red Taylor's Version,All Too Well,5,"It was rare, I was there",51
Red Taylor's Version,All Too Well,5,I remember it all too well,52
Red Taylor's Version,All Too Well,5,"Wind in my hair, you were there",53
Red Taylor's Version,All Too Well,5,You remember it all,54
Red Taylor's Version,All Too Well,5,"Down the stairs, you were there",55
