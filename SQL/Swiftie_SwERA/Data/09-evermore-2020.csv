evermore,willow,1,I'm like the water when your ship rolled in that night,1
evermore,willow,1,"Rough on the surface, but you cut through like a knife",2
evermore,willow,1,And if it was an open-shut case,3
evermore,willow,1,I never would've known from that look on your face,4
evermore,willow,1,Lost in your current like a priceless wine,5
evermore,willow,1,"The more that you say, the less I know",6
evermore,willow,1,"Wherever you stray, I follow",7
evermore,willow,1,I'm begging for you to take my hand,8
evermore,willow,1,"Wreck my plans, that's my man",9
evermore,willow,1,Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind,10
evermore,willow,1,"Head on the pillow, I could feel you sneakin' in",11
evermore,willow,1,As if you were a mythical thing,12
evermore,willow,1,Like you were a trophy or a champion ring,13
evermore,willow,1,And there was one prize I'd cheat to win,14
evermore,willow,1,"The more that you say, the less I know",15
evermore,willow,1,"Wherever you stray, I follow",16

evermore,willow,1,I'm begging for you to take my hand,21
evermore,willow,1,"Wreck my plans, that's my man",22
evermore,willow,1,Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind,23
evermore,willow,1,They count me out time and time again,24
evermore,willow,1,Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind,25
evermore,willow,1,But I come back stronger than a '90s trend,26
evermore,willow,1,"Wait for the signal, and I'll meet you after dark",27
evermore,willow,1,Show me the places where the others gave you scars,28
evermore,willow,1,Now this is an open-shut case,29
evermore,willow,1,I guess I should've known from the look on your face,30
evermore,willow,1,Every bait-and-switch was a work of art,31
evermore,willow,1,"The more that you say, the less I know",32
evermore,willow,1,"Wherever you stray, I follow",33
