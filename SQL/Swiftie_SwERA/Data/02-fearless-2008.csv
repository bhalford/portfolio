Fearless,Fearless,7,And I don't know why but with you I'd dance in a storm in my best dress,47
Fearless,Fearless,7,Fearless,48
Fearless,Fearless,7,Oh-oh,49
Fearless,Fearless,7,Oh yeah,50
Fearless,Fifteen,8,You take a deep breath and you walk through the doors,1
Fearless,Fifteen,8,It's the morning of your very first day,2
Fearless,Fifteen,8,"You say ""Hi"" to your friends you ain't seen in a while",3
Fearless,Fifteen,8,Try and stay out of everybody's way,4
Fearless,Fifteen,8,It's your freshman year and you're gonna be here,5
Fearless,Fifteen,8,For the next four years in this town,6
Fearless,Fifteen,8,Hoping one of those senior boys will wink at you and say,7
Fearless,Fifteen,8,"""You know I haven't seen you around before.""",8
Fearless,Fifteen,8,Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you,9
Fearless,Fifteen,8,You're gonna believe them,10
Fearless,Fifteen,8,And when you're fifteen,11
Fearless,Fifteen,8,Feeling like there's nothing to figure out,12
Fearless,Fifteen,8,"Well, count to ten, take it in",13
Fearless,Fifteen,8,This is life before you know who you're gonna be,14
Fearless,Fifteen,8,Fifteen,15
Fearless,Fifteen,8,You sit in class next to a redhead named Abigail,16
Fearless,Fifteen,8,And soon enough you're best friends,17
Fearless,Fifteen,8,Laughing at the other girls who think they're so cool,18
Fearless,Fifteen,8,We'll be out of here as soon as we can,19
Fearless,Fifteen,8,And then you're on your very first date and he's got a car,20
Fearless,Fifteen,8,And you're feeling like flying,21
Fearless,Fifteen,8,And your mamma's waiting up and you're thinking he's the one,22
Fearless,Fifteen,8,And you're dancing 'round your room when the night ends,23
Fearless,Fifteen,8,When the night ends,24
Fearless,Fifteen,8,Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you,25
Fearless,Fifteen,8,You're gonna believe them,26
Fearless,Fifteen,8,When you're fifteen,27
Fearless,Fifteen,8,And your first kiss makes your head spin 'round,28
Fearless,Fifteen,8,But in your life you'll do things greater than dating the boy on the football team,29
Fearless,Fifteen,8,But I didn't know it at fifteen,30
Fearless,Fifteen,8,When all you wanted was to be wanted,31
Fearless,Fifteen,8,Wish you could go back and tell yourself what you know now,32
Fearless,Fifteen,8,Back then I swore I was gonna marry him someday,33
Fearless,Fifteen,8,But I realized some bigger dreams of mine,34
Fearless,Fifteen,8,And Abigail gave everything she had to a boy who changed his mind,35
Fearless,Fifteen,8,And we both cried,36
Fearless,Fifteen,8,Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you,37
Fearless,Fifteen,8,You're gonna believe them,38
Fearless,Fifteen,8,And when you're fifteen,39
Fearless,Fifteen,8,Don't forget to look before you fall,40
Fearless,Fifteen,8,I've found time can heal most anything,41
Fearless,Fifteen,8,And you just might find who you're supposed to be,42
Fearless,Fifteen,8,I didn't know who I was supposed to be at fifteen,43
Fearless,Fifteen,8,"La, la, la, la, la, la, la",44
Fearless,Fifteen,8,"La, la, la, la, la, la, la",45
Fearless,Fifteen,8,"La, la, la, la, la, la, la",46
Fearless,Fifteen,8,Your very first day,47
Fearless,Fifteen,8,"Take a deep breath, girl",48
Fearless,Fifteen,8,Take a deep breath as you walk through the doors,49
Fearless,Love Story,9,We were both young when I first saw you,1
Fearless,Love Story,9,I close my eyes and the flashback starts:,2
Fearless,Love Story,9,I'm standing there,3
Fearless,Love Story,9,On a balcony in summer air,4
Fearless,Love Story,9,"See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns",5
Fearless,Love Story,9,See you make your way through the crowd,6
Fearless,Love Story,9,"And say, ""Hello.""",7
Fearless,Love Story,9,Little did I know,8
Fearless,Love Story,9,"That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles",9

Fearless,Love Story,9,And I said,13
Fearless,Love Story,9,"""Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone",14
Fearless,Love Story,9,I'll be waiting. All there's left to do is run,15
Fearless,Love Story,9,You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess,16
Fearless,Love Story,9,"It's a love story. Baby, just say 'Yes'.""",17
Fearless,Love Story,9,"So, I sneak out to the garden to see you",18
Fearless,Love Story,9,We keep quiet 'cause we're dead if they knew,19
Fearless,Love Story,9,"So, close your eyes",20
Fearless,Love Story,9,Escape this town for a little while,21
Fearless,Love Story,9,"Oh, oh",22
Fearless,Love Story,9,Cause you were Romeo. I was a scarlet letter,23
Fearless,Love Story,9,"And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet.""",24
Fearless,Love Story,9,But you were everything to me,25
Fearless,Love Story,9,"I was begging you, ""Please don't go!""",26
Fearless,Love Story,9,And I said,27
Fearless,Love Story,9,"""Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone",28
Fearless,Love Story,9,I'll be waiting. All there's left to do is run,29
Fearless,Love Story,9,You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess,30
Fearless,Love Story,9,"It's a love story. Baby, just say 'Yes'",31
Fearless,Love Story,9,"Romeo, save me. They're tryna tell me how to feel",32
Fearless,Love Story,9,This love is difficult but it's real,33
Fearless,Love Story,9,Don't be afraid. We'll make it out of this mess,34
Fearless,Love Story,9,"It's a love story. Baby, just say 'Yes'.""",35
Fearless,Love Story,9,"Oh, oh, oh",36
Fearless,Love Story,9,I got tired of waiting,37
Fearless,Love Story,9,Wondering if you were ever coming around,38
Fearless,Love Story,9,My faith in you was fading,39
Fearless,Love Story,9,When I met you on the outskirts of town,40
Fearless,Love Story,9,And I said,41
Fearless,Love Story,9,"""Romeo, save me. I've been feeling so alone",42
Fearless,Love Story,9,"I keep waiting for you, but you never come",43
Fearless,Love Story,9,"Is this in my head? I don't know what to think.""",44
Fearless,Love Story,9,He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring and said,45
Fearless,Love Story,9,"""Marry me, Juliet. You'll never have to be alone",46
Fearless,Love Story,9,"I love you, and that's all I really know",47
Fearless,Love Story,9,I talked to your dad. Go pick out a white dress,48
Fearless,Love Story,9,"It's a love story. Baby, just say 'Yes'.""",49
Fearless,Love Story,9,"Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh",50
Fearless,Love Story,9,Cause we were both young when I first saw you,51

Fearless,Hey Stephen,10,And as we walked,7
Fearless,Hey Stephen,10,We were talking,8
Fearless,Hey Stephen,10,I didn't say half the things I wanted to,9
Fearless,Hey Stephen,10,Of all the girls tossing rocks at your window,10

Fearless,The Best Day,18,I come home crying and you hold me tight and grab the keys,12
Fearless,The Best Day,18,And we drive and drive until we found a town far enough away,13
Fearless,The Best Day,18,And we talk and window shop 'til I've forgotten all their names,14
Fearless,The Best Day,18,I don't know who I'm going to talk to now at school,15
Fearless,The Best Day,18,But I know I'm laughing on the car ride home with you,16

Fearless,The Best Day,18,There is a video I found from back when I was three,24
Fearless,The Best Day,18,You set up a paint set in the kitchen and you're talking to me,25
Fearless,The Best Day,18,It's the age of princesses and pirate ships and the seven dwarfs,26
Fearless,The Best Day,18,And Daddy's smart,27
Fearless,The Best Day,18,And you're the prettiest lady in the whole wide world,28
